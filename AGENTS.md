# Global Instructions

- If a Nix operation needs a newly created file, stage that path first with `git add <path>`; untracked files are invisible to Nix flakes.

- Commit messages: use `scope: short description`, e.g. `kr7va: add audio support`.
- For host-specific module changes under `modules/config/+machines/<host>/`, use the host as the scope and include the module in the title as `host: module -> title`, e.g. `kr7va: niri -> extract config`.

## Den File & Aspect Structure Ordering

To keep configuration files consistent, follow this standardized order of keys/attributes:

### 1. File-Level Attribute Ordering

Within a `.nix` configuration file, order the top-level attributes as follows:

1. **Aspect Definition (`den.aspects.<name>`)**: Defines the feature/aspect; always at the top.
2. **Policies (`den.policies.<name>`)**: Relations/routing between entities.
3. **Schema Registrations (`den.schema.<type>.includes`)**: Wiring into the Den schema (e.g., custom class forwarders).
4. **Target Extensions (`den.default.<target>.extraModules`)**: Auxiliary options and configurations.
5. **Flake Source Declarations (`flake-file.inputs.<name>.url`)**: External input definitions at the very bottom.

### 2. Inner-Aspect Attribute Ordering

Within a `den.aspects.<name> = { ... }` block, order attributes as follows:

1. **Sub-aspects and Provisions (`provides` / `_`)**: Declared first to highlight exposed sub-capabilities.
2. **Custom / Application Classes (`zsh`, `tmux`, `nvim`, etc.)**: App-level configuration.
3. **User-level Classes (`hjem`, `homeManager`)**: Configurations targeted at the user environments.
4. **System-level Classes (`nixos`, `darwin`)**: Configurations targeted at OS levels.
5. **Auxiliary Account Classes (`user`)**: Base system user settings.
6. **Composition / Includes (`includes`)**: Aspect dependencies, listed at the end.

### 3. Provides Attribute Style

When an aspect has any `provides` entries, declare `provides` as a nested key inside the `den.aspects.<name> = { ... }` block, even if there is only one provision.

Do not write provisions with chained top-level assignments such as:

```nix
den.aspects.kr7va.provides.declnix.nixos = { ... };
```

Prefer:

```nix
den.aspects.kr7va = {
  provides.declnix.nixos = { ... };
};
```

### 4. Inline Plugin Package Definitions

For plugin-oriented aspects such as `zsh` and `tmux`, keep package fetches/builds inline with the plugin declaration that uses them. Do not hoist plugin packages into a shared outer `let` unless the same derivation is intentionally reused by multiple plugin entries or non-plugin settings.

### 5. Simple Console Tool Aspects

For simple console tool aspects that only install a package and add shell aliases or hooks, prefer direct `hjem.packages` plus `zsh.initConfig`. Do not create a custom `rum.programs.<tool>` module or `den.default.nixos.hjem.extraModules` block unless the tool needs reusable options, conditional behavior, or non-trivial integration logic.

### 6. Neovim Language Grouping

When a host-specific `nvim` class configures language tooling, split related settings with `lib.mkMerge` into domain groups that match that host's role, such as `frontend` and `backend` for a development workstation. Keep LSP presets, server overrides, and language declarations in the same domain block when they belong to the same host-specific toolchain.
